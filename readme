This project is about building a system (or process) that helps a travel agency efficiently plan, organize, and manage trips for customers.  
It will include features like creating customized travel packages, managing bookings (flights, hotels, transport), suggesting itineraries based on customer preferences, and handling budgets.  
The goal is to make trip planning faster, easier, and more personalized — improving customer satisfaction and streamlining operations for the agency.
